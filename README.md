# Introduction

kitchenBestie is a Recipe Search web application that allows users to search for recipes by entering the name of a dish or ingredient. The app uses the Spoonacular API to fetch the recipes and display them on the screen. The app also shows the estimated time required for the recipe and a link to the source for the recipe instructions.

# Technology

The KitchenBestie App is built using Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery. Flask is a web framework for Python that allows us to easily build web applications. HTML is used to structure the content of the app, CSS is used for styling, Bootstrap is used for responsive design, and jQuery is used for manipulating the DOM and making AJAX requests.

# Features

kitchenBestie recipe Search App has the following features:

- Search for recipes by entering the name of a dish or ingredient
- Display the recipe title, image, estimated time required, and link to source for recipe instructions
- Click on the link to the source to view the instructions for the recipe.

# Inspiration

The Recipe Search App was inspired by my love for cooking and finding easy ways to prepare delicious meals. The project was created as a portfolio project for the foundation sprint of the Holberton School (ALX) software engineering certification program.
